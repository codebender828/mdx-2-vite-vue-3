	Tomatoes are awesome{' '}
</div>

I make my case in defense of tomatoes today. Here's why:

- Tomato 1
- Tomato 2

* [x] Tomato 3
* [x] Tomato 4
* [ ] Tomato 5

### Here's a table explaining why tomatoes should be president.

| Tomato type | Reason                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plump       | Plump tomatoes are juicy and are healthy for ketchup. Hence president     |
| Cherry      | Cherry tomatoes are small and cute and must be protected at **ALL** costs |

```bash
yarn add tomato
```
